# sfml_dungeon_crawler_public

This is a game that I made for my university project using SFML library.

It's a dungeon crawler with random elements such as random map layout generation using BSP tree algorithm.

Feel free the check the code out.

Required SFML version is 2.5.1, assets folder contains all of the sprites and should be placed in project's root directory (or .exe file root directory).
